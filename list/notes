debuggin exception safe constructors is difficult because they provide a strong guarentee
each constructor must:
not leak memory,
clear ALL of its memory (including pre_head and aft_tail)

to make sure the constructor clears all of its memory, you can comment out the destrcutor and see if a throwing constructor leaks.
