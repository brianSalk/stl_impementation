insertion:
starts just like regulare insertion.
each new node is RED
if new_node has red parent, check new_nodes uncle.
	if new_node's uncle is also red, move the red up.
	if not, we need to do a rotation.	
		there are two rotations, right_rotate and left_rotate
		Q: which node do I call rotate on?
		Q: are left and right rotate identical except for the fact that I switch the words right and left?
